1.	Deleted vote pod
        Services are showing as running; Vote pod got re-spawned
        Both the web pages are accessible; The data in the results pod is retained and gets updated/modified when changes made in Vote web page
        
 2.	Delete Worker pod
Worker pod got re-spawned
Both the web pages are accessible; data is retained, this could be because of the worker pod pulling data from redis pod and data was persistent/retained in redis pod

3.	What happens after db pod deletion? 
Backend, db pod is re-spawned and both result and worker pod restarted

The data maintained in the db pod is lost and the web page is showing data pulled from new Voter and worker pod, which is restarted after db pod delete.
 
4.	WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
     a.	It lost connection with the db pod, as db pod was deleted
     b.	It establishes connection with db; but the table does not exists in db, hence throwing “Votes” does not exists

5.	your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.
    a.	No manual intervention needed to make the result pod work. 
    b.	In the code of worker, if the connection with db is lost; it will keep trying to connect to the db. Once it re-connects to the db, the worker creates the table “votes” if it is not already existing. 
    c. The results app also, try to re-connect to db app and once connection established, reads the table “votes” and display it.
 
 6.	Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the Training session
Replica set; Daemonset, statelessness, Nodeport
